 ***Legal Document Management and Drafting Software Powered by AI***
## Overview and Origin
Rally Legal was founded in 2017 in Newfoundland, Canada by Daniel Di Maria, Matthew Mayers, and Scott Stevenson[^1].  Originally founded as a web application where users can create and manage their contracts and company’s legal documents in a frictionless manner and entirely on the cloud, the company's focus shifted to the use of AI to review, revise, and comment on legal documents directly in Microsoft Word.  In May 2023, Rally Legal rebraded as [Spellbook Legal](www.spellbook.legal) after [raising $10.9 million dollars in an initial funding round](https://betakit.com/spellbook-formerly-rally-raises-10-9-million-to-automate-legal-contracts-using-generative-ai/) mainly from [Moxxie Ventures](https://www.moxxie.vc/).  Currently Spellbook is a legal software startup that developed the first generative artificial intelligence contract drafting tool. The technology, which is powered by huge language models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, is optimized for contracting performance utilizing legal datasets[^2].  
## Business Activites
Although the original purpose of the company was creating templates and managing contracts entirely in the cloud, in 2023 the company re-focused and its product offerings fundementally changed. Spellbook works as a Microsoft Word extension, capable of composing and analyzing contracts and other legal documents. The AI can then ‘cast spells’ to perform tasks like offering advice on adding new clauses, editing existing language, and otherwise improving the text within the context of the document as a whole. For contracts, that includes pinpointing where there is room for negotiation. Spellbook employs OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model ("LLM") to power its tools, an upgrade from its initial GPT-3 reliance.[^3].  In less than three months after the funidng round opened up the use of OpenAI's GPT-4's LLM, Spellbook launched an active AI reviewing tool that uses specific legal databases and LLMs to provide on demand identification of risks and points of negotiations (in legal-ese, the ability to redline a document in record time and reccomend proposed changes based on the party represented).  In addition, Spellbook's add-in can take direction and edits directly from a user and revise an entire document based on those edits.  Spellbook claims its Spellbook Review feature can:
- *Negotiating an agreement for a client: Reviews marks up the contract for you, requesting changes from the counterparty based on your desired level of aggressiveness.*
- *Repurposing an old precedent for a new deal: Reviews can take your instructions and make appropriate revisions across the whole document.*
- *Ensuring an employment agreement is appropriate for a new jurisdiction: Reviews can highlight issues and suggest edits that would fix the issues.*
- *Running common negotiation playbooks: Save a set of instructions for Spellbook to follow, and have it instantly execute your negotiation playbook on any contract.*
