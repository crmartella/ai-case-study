## Legal Document Management and Drafting Software Powered by AI
## Overview and Origin
Rally Legal was founded in 2017 in Newfoundland, Canada by Daniel Di Maria, Matthew Mayers, and Scott Stevenson.  Originally founded as a web application where users can create and manage their contracts and companyâ€™s legal documents in a frictionless manner and entirely on the cloud, the company's focus shifted to the use of AI to review, revise, and comment on legal documents directly in Microsoft Word.  In May 2023, Rally Legal rebraded as [Spellbook Legal](www.spellbook.legal)after [raising $10.9 million dollars in an initial funding round](https://betakit.com/spellbook-formerly-rally-raises-10-9-million-to-automate-legal-contracts-using-generative-ai/) mainly from [Moxxie Ventures](https://www.moxxie.vc/)
