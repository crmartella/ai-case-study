 ***Legal Document Management and Drafting Software Powered by AI***
 
## Overview and Origin
Rally Legal was founded in 2017 in Newfoundland, Canada by Daniel Di Maria, Matthew Mayers, and Scott Stevenson.[^1]  Originally founded as a web application where users can create and manage their contracts and company’s legal documents in a frictionless manner and entirely on the cloud, the company's focus shifted to the use of AI to review, revise, and comment on legal documents directly in Microsoft Word.  In May 2023, Rally Legal rebraded as [Spellbook Legal](www.spellbook.legal) after [raising $10.9 million dollars in an initial funding round](https://betakit.com/spellbook-formerly-rally-raises-10-9-million-to-automate-legal-contracts-using-generative-ai/) mainly from [Moxxie Ventures](https://www.moxxie.vc/).  Currently Spellbook is a legal software startup that developed the first generative artificial intelligence contract drafting tool. The technology, which is powered by huge language models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, is optimized for contracting performance utilizing legal datasets.[^2]  
## Business Activites
Although the original purpose of the company was creating templates and managing contracts entirely in the cloud, in 2023 the company re-focused and its product offerings fundementally changed. Spellbook works as a Microsoft Word extension, capable of composing and analyzing contracts and other legal documents. The AI can then ‘cast spells’ to perform tasks like offering advice on adding new clauses, editing existing language, and otherwise improving the text within the context of the document as a whole. For contracts, that includes pinpointing where there is room for negotiation. Spellbook employs OpenAI’s GPT-4 large language model ("LLM") to power its tools, an upgrade from its initial GPT-3 reliance.[^3]  In less than three months after the funidng round opened up the use of OpenAI's GPT-4's LLM, Spellbook launched an active AI reviewing tool that uses specific legal databases and LLMs to provide on demand identification of risks and points of negotiations (in legal-ese, the ability to redline a document in record time and reccomend proposed changes based on the party represented).  In addition, Spellbook's add-in can take direction and edits directly from a user and revise an entire document based on those edits.  Spellbook claims its Spellbook Review feature can:
- *Negotiating an agreement for a client: Reviews marks up the contract for you, requesting changes from the counterparty based on your desired level of aggressiveness.*
- *Repurposing an old precedent for a new deal: Reviews can take your instructions and make appropriate revisions across the whole document.*
- *Ensuring an employment agreement is appropriate for a new jurisdiction: Reviews can highlight issues and suggest edits that would fix the issues.*
- *Running common negotiation playbooks: Save a set of instructions for Spellbook to follow, and have it instantly execute your negotiation playbook on any contract.*

Initial reviews and the Founders statements have been amazingly positive:
>"The capabilities of Reviews has blown away the expectations of our own team," shared Scott Stevenson, Co-Founder and CEO of Spellbook. "It suggests precise, nuanced edits for contracts – which is exactly what many lawyers we work with have been asking us to build. Spellbook Reviews takes the first pass through documents, identifying specific improvements, hidden risks, and even potential objections a counterparty may have. This empowers lawyers to invest their time in higher-level activities more than ever before."[^4]

>“We believe Spellbook Reviews will provide enormous power to legal teams of all sizes – from large, to mid-sized, to small firms, and even solo lawyers,” shared Daniel Di Maria, Co-Founder and COO of Spellbook. “At Spellbook, we've been able to bring our legal and technical backgrounds together in a way that has allowed us to develop products and features that are breaking molds and barriers across both industries. And we’re thrilled to see our beta users getting so much value already from Reviews, ultimately enabling them to focus on adding strategic value and providing better work products for clients.” [^5]
## Landscape
Thompson Reuters, the owner of Westlaw, one of the largest and oldest legal research companies, see AI and the use of generative AI as the most substaintail change in the practice of law since the internet.  A 2023 study by Goldman Sachs estimated the share of different industries' employment exposed to replacement by AI automation in the United States. The legal profession had the second highest exposure, with an estimated 44% of tasks susceptible to automation. [^6] In Straits Research's 2023 anaylsis of AI in the legal landscape and Grand View Research's similar report, they highlighted that the global legal AI market size is estimated at US $1.04 billion in 2022 with a compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of 18.2% through 2030. [^7].  Beyond document drafting, AI is applicable in the e-discovery and legal research markets, along with the timekeeping and billing arenas.  Both of the aformentioned reports idnetified six key hihglights in the legal AI industries over the next seven years:

>The global AI software market in legal industry was valued at USD 719.5 million in 2022. It is expected to reach USD 7,252.8 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 29.27% during the forecast period (2023–2031).
>
>Based on the component, the global AI software market in legal industry is bifurcated into solutions and services. The solution segment is the highest contributor to the market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 28.05% during the forecast period.
>
>Based on the deployment, the global AI software market in legal industry is bifurcated into on-premise and cloud. The cloud segment owns the highest market share and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30.31% during the forecast period.
>
>Based on the application, the global AI software market in legal industry is bifurcated into legal research, contract review and management, e-billing, e-discovery, compliance, and case prediction. The e-billing segment is the highest contributor to the market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 28.49% during the forecast period.
>
>Based on the end-user, the global AI software market in legal industry is bifurcated into law firms and corporate legal departments. The law firm segment owns the highest market share and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 28.66% during the forecast period.
>
>North America is the most significant contributor to the global AI software market in legal industry and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 27.24% during the forecast period.
